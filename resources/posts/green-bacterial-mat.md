Cyanobacteria _Calothrix_

    pH: 6–9
    Temperature: 30–45°C (86–113°F)
    Color: Dark brown mats
    Metabolism: Photosynthesis by day; fermentation by night.

Cyanobacteria _Phormidium_

    pH: 6–8
    Temperature: 35–57°C (95–135°F)
    Color: Orange mats
    Metabolism: Photosynthesis

Cyanobacteria _Oscillatoria_

    pH: 6–8
    Temperature: 36–45°C (96–113°F)
    Color: Orange mats
    Metabolism: Photosynthesis; oscillating moves it closer to 
    or away from light sources.

Cyanobacteria _Synechococcus_

    pH: 7–9
    Temperature: 52–74°C (126–165°F)
    Color: Green mats
    Metabolism: Photosynthesis by day; fermentation by night.

Green Sulfur _Chlorobium_

    pH: 6–9
    Temperature: 32–52°C (90–126°F)
    Color: Dense, dark green mats
    Metabolism: Anoxygenic photosynthesis— produces sulfate 
    and sulfur, not oxygen.

Green nonsulfur _Chloroflexus_

    pH: 7–9
    Temperature: 35–85°C (95–185°F)
    Color: Green mats
    Metabolism: Anoxygenic photosynthesis

Aquifex _Hydrogenobaculum_

    pH: 3–5.5
    Temperature: 55–72°C (131–162°F)
    Color: Yellow and white streamers
    Metabolism: Uses hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide 
    as energy sources; can use arsenic in place of hydrogen sulfide.

Deinococcus-Thermus _Thermus_

    pH: 5–9
    Temperature: 40–79°C (104–174°F)
    Color: Bright red or orange streamers; contains carotenoid 
    pigments that act as sunscreen.
